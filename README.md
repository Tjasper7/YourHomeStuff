# YourHomeStuff

This is a small app called YourHomeStuff written in swift 3 using Xcode 8 beta. You can add items to the tableview and update the name, serial, and value for the row. 
Currently when adding a row it is generating a random adjective and noun inside the `Item.swift` model. 

The `ImageStore` is handling the caching of the images.
`ImageStore` has three main functions for adding, retriving, and deleting the image with the corresponding key
``` 
setImage
imageForKey
deleteImageForKey
imageURLForKey
```

The `Item` is also using `NSCoding` so look at that to see an example of setting up a object model for NSCoding. 
For a stackView example check out `DetailItemViewController` in storyboard
